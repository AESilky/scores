# Score Board
Two team score board w/remote for use in the yard when playing different games
like ladder-ball, cornhole, horseshoes, etc.

Uses a Comcast/Xfinity X1 remote to control the score. This remote uses Zigby
for wireless, non line of sight, communication, and IR for line of sight.

The board uses multiplexed 7 segment LED displays to provide a two team/player
two digit score, plus a two digit number that can count periods, innings,
quarters, etc., or can count down/up time. There are four LEDs under the score
for each side that can be used to indicate timeouts left, substitutions made,
etc.
