/**
 * @brief Cursor Switches functionality through analog input.
 * @ingroup curswitch
 *
 * This reads analog inputs for values indicating switch presses. The switches are laid out in
 * a cursor pattern (as below). Each switch is connected via a voltage divider such that it
 * produces a unique value when pressed. Some combinations can also be detected (with less
 * certainty).
 *
 * A bank is laid out with switches as follows with each switch producing the indicated voltage:
 *
 *                  < UP - n.nn >
 *  < LF - n.nn >   < HM - n.nn >   < RT - n.nn >
 *                  < DN - n.nn >
 *
 *                  < ENTER - 0 >
 *
 * The switch voltage input for a bank is through either, or both, of the IR inputs on the board.
